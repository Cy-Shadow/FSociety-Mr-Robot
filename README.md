fork of manisso's fsociety, for pull request.

README, MANISSO.
the issues i've fixed are about the pip packages being packages not available anymore.
and the second issue, in line 185 of the python file, being that it tries to write the fsociety.cfg file, but it cannot due to python3.
and another issue is that you've used print"" without brackets.
